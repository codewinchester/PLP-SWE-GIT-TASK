# PLP-SWE-GIT-TASK
Just explaining the steps i took to clone a random repository in my local machine. <br>
First step was to find a public repository i could clone 
Then i copied the repository's HTTPS link.
I then went ahead and opened up my git app
Which i later keyed in the command 'Git clone https://github.com/dejwid/mern-blog.git 
The cloning was succesfully achieved.
