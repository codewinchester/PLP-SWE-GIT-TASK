# PLP-SWE-GIT-TASK
PLP's Software engineering git and github tasks <br> <br>
Just explaining the steps i took to accomplish git and github tasks. The first task was cloning  <br> <br>
First step was to find a public repository i could clone <br> <br>
Then i copied the repository's HTTPS link. <br> <br>

I then went ahead and opened up my git app <br> <br>
Which i later keyed in the command 'Git clone https://github.com/dejwid/mern-blog.git <br> <br>
The cloning was succesfully achieved. <br> <br>

The next task was forking. <br> <br>
Forking is requesting Github to register another person's public repository under your ID. <br> <br>
