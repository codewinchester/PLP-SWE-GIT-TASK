Just explaining the steps i took to clone a random repository in my local machine. <br>
First step was to find a public repository i could clone <br>
Then i copied the repository's HTTPS link. <br>

I then went ahead and opened up my git app <br>
Which i later keyed in the command 'Git clone https://github.com/dejwid/mern-blog.git <br>
The cloning was succesfully achieved. <br>
